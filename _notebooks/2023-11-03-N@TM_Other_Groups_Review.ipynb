After getting everything ready, we started presenting to whoever was interested/came up to us. It was getting easier as time went on but I was still counting down the time. After we were done, I went around just to see what other groups were doing and found some really good ones.\n",

Although I feel that we could've done more, I'm glad I got this opportunity to showcase and also see what others have been working on. I see the level that we are supposed to be working at and to show off. I will strive to do better in the future to make even better works.\n",

It was really cool to see what they were doing and I want to make something like that. It was really smooth and ran well on their computer. I definetly would like to see how far that game can go if there was even more time as they didn't fully finish their combat function as there was the same animation for each attack. With more time, they could make something way more cooler."
