What I Did
8/24/23

Was able to get image to work on website.



8/23/23

Tried looking for ways to put the picture but then ended up finding all these videos but then these videos didn't end up working and they just left off into the same spot I was already.



8/22/23

Tried to put an image on my site but could only get a link to work. No image was poping up except link.



8/21/23

Install not working for python and gem so asked Theo for help and it worked.





What I learned

How to use images and to work with my website.
